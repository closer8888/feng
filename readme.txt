	System requirements
	===================
	
	Feng Office requires a running Web Server, PHP (5.0 or greater) and MySQL (InnoDB
	support recommended). The recommended Web Server is Apache.
	
	Feng Office is not PHP4 compatible and it will not run on PHP versions prior
	to PHP 5.
	
	Recommendations:
	
	PHP 5.2+
	MySQL 5+ with InnoDB support
	Apache 2.0+
	
		* PHP    : http://www.php.net/
		* MySQL  : http://www.mysql.com/
		* Apache : http://www.apache.org/
	
	Please have a look at our requirements here:
	http://www.fengoffice.com/web/wiki/doku.php/installation:server_reqs
	
	Alternatively, if you just want to test Feng Office and you don't care about security
	issues with your files, you can download XAMPP, which includes all that is needed
	by Feng Office (Apache, PHP 5, MySQL) in a single download.
	You can configure MySQL to support InnoDB by commenting or removing
	the line 'skip-innodb' in the file '<INSTALL_DIR>/etc/my.cnf'.
	
		* XAMPP  : http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp


	Installation
	============
	
	1. Download Feng Office - http://fengoffice.com/web/community/
	2. Unpack and upload to your web server
	3. Direct your browser to the public/install directory and follow the installation procedure
	
	Further information can be found here: http://www.fengoffice.com/web/wiki/doku.php/installation:installation
 
	You should be finished in a matter of minutes.
	
	4. Some functionality may require further configuration, like setting up a cron job.
	Check the wiki for more information: http://fengoffice.com/web/wiki/doku.php/setup
	
	WARNING: Default memory limit por PHP is 8MB. As a new Feng Office install consumes about 10 MB,
	administrators could get a message similar to "Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted".
	This can be solved by setting "memory_limit=32" in php.ini.
